## üëã Introduction

This is an automatically generated OpenAPI specification for the Steamworks Web API. It allows you to [explore the endpoints through the Swagger UI](https://ceva24.github.io/openapi-steamworks-web-api/) and try out some of the requests, and is intended to complement the official [Steamworks Web API Reference](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) and [developer wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API).

The specification is regenerated regularly so should be an accurate reflection of the current state of the API.

## üîß Prerequisites

Many of the endpoints require you to pass an API key as part of the request. You can [request one for your Steam account](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

## üóíÔ∏è How to use

You can freely [browse all of the available endpoints](https://ceva24.github.io/openapi-steamworks-web-api/). You can try them out by filling in any required fields and executing the request, which will show the resulting URL of the request and a curl implementation.

**Important note**: Requests sent through the UI will always fail due to CORS errors. You can copy the URL or curl command to run these locally without issue.

## ‚ùó Caveats

-   This project relies on an endpoint provided by Valve Software to generate the specification - not all API endpoints are documented in this (including many of those for `https://partner.steam-api.com`), though most of the core ones are available. If in doubt refer to the [Steamworks Web API Reference](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi).
-   Conversely this specification includes a number of endpoints that aren't included in the [Steamworks Web API Reference](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) for whatever reason.
-   This is an opinionated specification - the API allows you to do things like pass the `key` parameter as a query string parameter or in some cases as a form field. In our case we always pass it as a query string parameter.
-   For simplicity all endpoints have been marked as requiring authentication, but some of the endpoints are public. You can determine this by consulting the relevant page in the [Steamworks Web API Reference](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) - or just try it!
-   Most endpoints target the `https://api.steampowered.com` domain, but some are for `https://partner.steam-api.com`. You can select the server at the top of the specification, but you'll need to refer to the [Steamworks Web API Reference](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) to find out which domain you need to target.
-   Many endpoints allow you to pass an [`input_json` parameter](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview#3) - you'll need to [URL-encode this yourself](https://www.urlencoder.io/).
-   Be aware that some endpoints will respond with `HTTP 200` whilst containing an error message in the response body ü§∑
